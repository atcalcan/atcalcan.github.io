    <h1>Comparison of Discord and Skype</h1>

    <h2>Task 1: Delivering an academic presentation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Affordances: Both Discord and Skype allow for screen sharing, video conferencing, and real-time messaging,
            which are useful for delivering academic presentations.</li>
        <li>Visual variables: Discord offers customizable themes, including dark mode, which can be helpful for reducing
            eye strain during extended presentations. Skype also allows for screen sharing, but it does not offer
            customizable themes.</li>
        <li>Interaction flows: Both Discord and Skype have similar interaction flows, where the presenter can share
            their screen while also being able to speak and interact with the audience in real-time.</li>
        <li>Proposed improvement: Discord's customizable themes can be further improved by allowing users to create
            their own themes and share them with the community. This would give users more control over their visual
            experience and also promote community engagement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Task 2: Attending a meeting at late hours</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Affordances: Both Discord and Skype allow for real-time messaging and voice chat, which can be useful for
            attending meetings at late hours.</li>
        <li>Visual variables: Discord's dark mode can be helpful in reducing eye strain during extended meetings. Skype
            does not offer a customizable theme.</li>
        <li>Interaction flows: Both Discord and Skype have similar interaction flows, where participants can communicate
            through real-time messaging and voice chat.</li>
        <li>Proposed improvement: Both Discord and Skype can be improved by adding a feature that allows users to
            schedule meetings in different time zones, which can help users attend meetings at more convenient times.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Comparison of visual metaphors and idioms</h2>
    <p>Discord and Skype both use similar visual metaphors and idioms, such as icons for muting and unmuting
        microphones, raising hands, and sharing screens. For a text-only interaction, similar visual metaphors and
        idioms can be implemented using text-based commands, such as /mute to mute the microphone and /share to share
        the screen.</p>

    <h2>Cognitive overload in special conditions/contexts</h2>
    <p>Cognitive overload can occur when there is an excessive amount of information presented to the user, which can
        lead to difficulty in processing the information. In the context of remote communication applications, cognitive
        overload can occur during video conferencing, where there are multiple people speaking, as well as when using
        multiple applications simultaneously.</p>

    <h2>Three improvements to optimize these applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>UI/UX problem identified: Discord and Skype can be overwhelming for new users who are not familiar with the
            interface. Solution suggested: Both applications can include interactive tutorials that guide new users
            through the interface and highlight important features.</li>
        <li>UI/UX problem identified: Discord and Skype can be resource-intensive and may cause lag on low-end devices.
            Solution suggested: Both applications can include low-resource mode, which reduces the amount of processing
            power and bandwidth required to run the application.</li>
        <li>UI/UX problem identified: Discord and Skype do not offer translation services for real-time messaging and
            voice chat. Solution suggested: Both applications can include translation services for real-time messaging
            and voice chat, allowing users to communicate with people who speak different languages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reconsidering/Adapting Empiric Laws in Multi-Device Interaction</h2>
    <p>The empiric laws of Fitts, Hick, and Steering are designed to guide the design of user interfaces for single
        devices. In the context of multi-device interaction, these laws can still be useful but may need to be adapted
        to account for different interaction flows and the use of multiple devices.</p>

    <h2>Three new features to improve the experience</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Feature: Persistent voice chat rooms. Sketch: Users can create persistent voice chat rooms that remain
            active even when no one is present. This can be useful for communities that want to maintain a sense of
            presence even when users are not actively engaging in conversation.</li>
        <li>Feature: Customizable hotkeys. Sketch: Users can customize hotkeys for frequently used commands, such as
            muting and unmuting the microphone or sharing the screen. This can help users save time and reduce cognitive
            load by reducing the number of clicks required to perform these actions.</li>
        <li>Feature: Smart notifications. Sketch: Users can enable smart notifications that filter notifications based
            on the importance of the message. This can help reduce notification overload and ensure that users are only
            notified for important messages.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Contribution</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, our team has compared and evaluated the features and functionalities of Discord and Skype for
        remote communication. Each team member contributed equally to the project: Sami conducted the initial research
        and data collection, Stefan analyzed the data and identified key differences in affordances and interaction
        flows, and Alex presented the findings and proposed new features for future development. We hope that this
        comparison will help users make an informed decision when choosing between Discord and Skype for their
        communication needs.</p>
