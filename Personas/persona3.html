				<h4>Detailed Description:</h4>
				<p>Vincent is a technology enthusiast who enjoys spending most of his time in virtual environments. He is an avid gamer and prefers online gaming communities over physical activities. He works in an office environment and does not engage in regular physical exercise. Due to a mobility impairment, he cannot participate in physical activities like airsoft. Vincent finds physical challenges frustrating and prefers hobbies that do not require physical exertion.</p>
				<p>While Vincent appreciates technology and enjoys exploring virtual and augmented reality experiences, the physical demands and competitive nature of airsoft matches do not align with his interests and capabilities. He may find it uncomfortable or impractical to wear augmented reality glasses due to his mobility impairment.</p>
				<p>In this scenario, Vincent represents a negative persona for the airsoft application as he has limitations that prevent him from engaging with the physical aspects of the game. Understanding negative personas like Vincent can help the developers and designers of the airsoft application better tailor their product to accommodate a diverse range of users with varying needs and preferences. </p>
