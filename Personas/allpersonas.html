	<p><strong> The role of personas in HCI is to provide designers and developers with a deeper understanding of the target users. By using personas, designers can empathize with users and make design decisions that align with their needs and expectations. Personas help to humanize the design process and keep the focus on the end users throughout the development cycle.</strong></p>
	<p>We used four personas types (primary, secondary, negative and customer) to help us understand what the users want and what users are most likely to use our product.

          <p>Benjamin is a passionate outdoor enthusiast with a particular interest in tactical games and airsoft. He has been actively participating in airsoft matches for several years and values teamwork and strategic thinking in gameplay. Benjamin enjoys the physical aspect of airsoft and sees it as an opportunity to stay fit and meet like-minded individuals.</p>
          <p>As an experienced airsoft player, Benjamin seeks a mobile application that can provide him with enhanced gameplay experiences. He values simplicity and efficiency in the setup process, as he dislikes spending too much time configuring match settings and assembling teams. The user-interface of the application should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing Benjamin to quickly organize teams, select game types, and adjust match parameters.</p>
          <p>One of Benjamin's frustrations is the difficulty in finding organized airsoft matches and reliable teammates. The application should provide a platform for him to connect with other players, join existing teams, and schedule matches. This will enable Benjamin to have a more structured and enjoyable airsoft experience.</p>
          <p>Additionally, Benjamin desires access to real-time information about his weapon replica's stats during matches. The application's integration with the internal Bluetooth unit of the weapon replica would allow him to monitor ammo levels, battery capacity, and other maintenance data. This information would enhance his gameplay and tactical decision-making on the field.</p>
          <p>Benjamin's goals revolve around improving his tactical skills, fostering teamwork, and maintaining an active lifestyle. The application can support him in achieving these goals by providing a community-driven platform, access to real-time weapon data, and a variety of game types and match settings.</p>
       	  <p>In this scenario, Benjamin represents a customer persona for the airsoft application. He is an experienced player who values convenience, teamwork, and access to real-time data. By understanding the needs and preferences of customers like Benjamin, the developers and designers of the application can create a tailored experience that meets their expectations and enhances their enjoyment of airsoft matches.</p>
