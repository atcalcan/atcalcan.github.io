				<h4>Detailed Description:</h4>
				<p>Lucas is a casual gamer who has limited experience with airsoft games. He enjoys trying out different types of games but doesn't have extensive knowledge about advanced tactics and strategies. As a freelancer, Lucas has a flexible schedule that allows him to dedicate time to his hobbies, including airsoft.</p>
				<p>While Lucas is interested in the application, he may struggle with complex user interfaces. He prefers intuitive and user-friendly designs that are easy to navigate. Providing a streamlined and straightforward user interface will greatly enhance Lucas' experience and make it easier for him to engage with the application.</p>
				<p>Lucas's goal is to improve his skills in airsoft games and have fun while playing. He is also interested in connecting with other airsoft enthusiasts and potentially joining a local team. The application can help facilitate his goals by providing a platform for him to interact with other players, join teams, and access resources for learning and improving his gameplay.</p>
				<p>In this scenario, Lucas represents a secondary persona for the airsoft application. While he may not initially be highly skilled or experienced with the product, he has an interest in airsoft and is motivated to improve. Understanding secondary personas like Lucas helps the developers and designers of the airsoft application cater to the needs of a broader range of users, including those who are new to the game or have average proficiency.</p>

			<li>With time and perseverance, Lucas learns how to navigate the application and customize his gameplay settings.</li>
			<li>He participates in airsoft matches using the application and gradually improves his skills.</li>
			<li>Lucas joins a local airsoft team through the application's community features, allowing him to connect with like-minded players and engage in more organized matches.</li>
