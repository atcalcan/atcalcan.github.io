  <h1>HCI Project Documentation: User Interface Design for Airsoft Player Application</h1>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this documentation is to provide an overview of the user interface design for a web/mobile application dedicated to groups of airsoft players. The application aims to enhance the experience of airsoft teams by providing multi-language support for setting up player teams, game type selection, match duration and score, and other preferences. It also offers integration with the internal Bluetooth unit of the weapon replica, providing information such as ammo left, battery capacity and usage, and other maintenance data. Additionally, the system syncs with a smartwatch and a pair of augmented reality glasses to provide contextual information for each player during a match.</p>

  <h2>2. Interaction Design Patterns</h2>
  <p>The UI prototype designed in Figma incorporates various interaction design patterns to ensure intuitive and efficient user interactions. Some of the key patterns used in the prototypes are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Navigation Drawer: The navigation drawer pattern is used to provide easy access to various sections of the application, such as team setup, game type selection, match configuration, weapon information, and synchronization options. Users can access these sections by opening the navigation drawer from the app's main screen.</li>
    <li>Form-based Input: Form-based input is employed for setting up teams, selecting game types, configuring match duration and score limits, and specifying other preferences. This pattern ensures structured data entry, validation, and a consistent user experience.</li>
    <li>List View: The list view pattern is utilized for displaying teams, game types, and other relevant information. Users can view, add, edit, and delete items in these lists to manage their team composition and game preferences effectively.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. User Flow</h2>
  <p>The user flow within the application is designed to provide a seamless experience for airsoft players. The primary user flow includes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Launching the application: Upon launching the application, users are presented with the main screen, featuring the app's logo and navigation options in the form of a navigation drawer.</li>
    <li>Team setup and game type selection: Users can navigate to the team setup screen from the navigation drawer to create, edit, or delete teams. After team setup, they can select the desired game type from the game type selection screen.</li>
    <li>Weapon information and Bluetooth integration: Users can access screens displaying weapon-related information and options to sync with the internal Bluetooth unit of their weapon replicas. This allows them to monitor ammo, battery capacity and usage, and perform necessary maintenance tasks.</li>
    <li>Smartwatch and augmented reality glasses integration: The application syncs with a smartwatch and augmented reality glasses to provide contextual information during a match. Real-time match data, player stats, maps, and objectives are displayed on the smartwatch and overlaid on the glasses using augmented reality techniques.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>4. Affective Factors and Emotion</h2>
  <p>The design of the application takes into account affective factors and emotions to create a positive user experience. Visual design, feedback and responsiveness, personalization and error handling are some of the aspects considered:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visual Design: The visual design of the application is aimed at evoking excitement and engagement associated with airsoft gameplay. A visually appealing color scheme and graphics are used to create an immersive experience.</li>
    <li>Feedback and Responsiveness: The application provides immediate and meaningful feedback to user actions, enhancing the sense of control and engagement. Visual and haptic feedback is employed where appropriate.</li>
    <li>Error Handling: The application employs thoughtful error handling with clear error messages, helping users understand and recover from mistakes or issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Interaction Types/Paradigms</h2>
  <p>The airsoft player application incorporates three interaction types/paradigms to cater to different user preferences and provide a diverse user experience:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Traditional Interaction: The application utilizes traditional interaction methods such as touch, taps, swipes, and button presses for navigation, form-based input, and general interactions within the user interface.</li>
    <li>Gestural+Haptic Interaction: The application incorporates gestural+Haptic interaction, allowing users to perform touch gestures such as swiping, pinching, or shaking to interact with the application. Haptic feedback is employed to provide tactile sensations or vibrations, enhancing the user's sense of control and immersion.</li>
    <li>Mixed Reality: The application integrates with smartwatches and augmented reality glasses to provide contextual information during matches.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the user interface design for the airsoft player application aims to provide a comprehensive and engaging experience for airsoft teams. The design incorporates interaction design patterns, ensures a seamless user flow, considers affective factors and emotions, and incorporates three interaction types/paradigms. By considering these aspects, the application aims to enhance the overall airsoft gameplay experience and facilitate smooth and efficient team coordination.</p>
  <p>Our team members contributed equally to the project. Sami conducted thorough research, handled documentation, and created the video presentation. Stefan developed the four mandatory personas, and Alex designed the user interface using Figma.</p>
